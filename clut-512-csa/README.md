## Clut CSA Sample

The idea here is to demonstrate how to use CSA while using CLUT. Here we set up a CLUT of 512 entries, this is possible using 16-bit color format. Then we increment the CSA which allows us to move through the CLUT by groups of 16 indexes in our case.

## Usage
1. Compile the code using `make clean; make;`.
2. Run the binary on a PSP (recommended over using an emulator).
