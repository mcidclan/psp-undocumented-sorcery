# PSP Bewitched Texture
This sample draws a texture using GU_POINTS (referred to here as a 'bewitched' texture) through `Clear` mode forcing the alpha channel values to be set. This texture is then blended with a standard texture and output to the frame buffer. The resulting output texture will have its alpha values matching those of the `bewitched` texture, while the RGB values are blended between both textures. The code provides example tools for selecting which texture will control the alpha channel.
